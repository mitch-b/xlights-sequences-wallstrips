# xLights Sequences
## Wallstrip LEDs

This is a collection of xLights sequences for my wallstrip LEDs.  The wallstrips are 5V WS2812B strips with 59 LEDs on each strip. The strips are powered by a 5V 10A power supply.  The strips are controlled by a QuinLED Dig-Quad board. I am running xLights on a Raspberry Pi 4B.

These are relatively simple - since I have 3 straight LED strips to sequence, and no complex props.
